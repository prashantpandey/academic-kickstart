My current research focuses on building efficient filter data structures for approximate membership testing and counting. I also work on building write-optimized data structures for online event-detection problem in streaming data sets. I am also a member of the team that developed [BetrFS](http://www.betrfs.org/), an in-kernel file system built on write-optimized indexes.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the School of Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/). I work with [Prof. Carl Kingsford](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/) on building compact data structures for large-scale sequence-search and representation of de Bruijn graphs for DNA sequencing and transcriptomic analysis.

Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Stony Brook University](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/), and defended my dissertation, [Fast and Space-Efficient Maps: Shrinking Big Data Down to Size](files/prashant_pandey_thesis_2018_submitted.pdf). At Stony brook University, I was co-advised by [Prof. Michael Bender](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~bender/) and [Prof. Rob Johnson](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~rob/). (Dissertation committee: [Mike Ferdman](https://compas.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mferdman/), [Rob Patro](http://www.robpatro.com/redesign/), [Guy Blelloch](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/).)
