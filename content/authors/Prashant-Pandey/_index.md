<!--My current research focuses on building efficient filter data structures for
approximate membership testing and counting. I also work on building
write-optimized data structures for online event-detection problem in streaming
data sets. I am also a member of the team that developed
[BetrFS](http://www.betrfs.org/), an in-kernel file system built on
write-optimized indexes.-->

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Computer Science Department at
[Berkeley Lab](https://crd.lbl.gov/departments/computer-science/PAR/) working
with [Prof.  Aydin Buluc](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aydin/) and [Prof.
Katherine Yelick](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yelick/).  My research
interests lie at the intersection of systems and algorithms. I design and build
theoretically well-founded data structures for big data problems in
computational biology, storage, and streaming.

Previously, I spent one year as a postdoc at the School of Computer Science at
[Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) working with [Prof. Carl
Kingsford](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/). I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer
Science at [Stony Brook University](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/), and
defended my dissertation, [Fast and Space-Efficient Maps: Shrinking Big Data
Down to Size](files/prashant_pandey_thesis_2018_submitted.pdf). At Stony brook
University, I was co-advised by [Prof. Michael
Bender](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~bender/) and [Prof. Rob
Johnson](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~rob/). (Dissertation committee: [Mike
Ferdman](https://compas.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mferdman/), [Rob
Patro](http://www.robpatro.com/redesign/), [Guy
Blelloch](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/).)

<span style="background-color: #E76E4D"> I am currently applying for faculty
positions. I am interested in positions both in the US and abroad.
[Here](files/JobMaterialCombined.pdf) is my material. Please reach out to me if
you think I would be a good addition to your department or research group!

I love outdoors and occasionally like to scribble my experience in a
[blog](https://hikingscribbles.wordpress.com/).
